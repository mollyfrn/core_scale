#Occupancy-scale analysis

# author: Molly F. Jenkins
# date: 06/27/2017

####Summary####
#This script takes a dataset of BBS routes with occupancy values calculated for every scale, 
#scales ranging in size from 1/10th of a BBS route to 66 aggregated BBS routes. 
#Using this data we analyze the relationship between temporal occupancy of communities and scale. 
#We characterize this relationship in a series of simple linear models between occupancy and scale 
#(using log(area) as our variable of spatial scale). From these models and our existing data, 
#for every focal route we traced how occupancy changes across scale, from smallest to largest scale. 
#We characterized these changes through a series of variables: 
#1)the occupancy value at the minimum scale for a focal route 
#2)the occupancy value at the maximum scale for a focal route 
#3)the slope of the line linking the minimum and maximum values 
#the steepness (or flatness) of this line corresponds with the rate of accumulation of core species 
#for a given community 
#4)the scale at which mean occupancy first reaches or surpasses 50% 
#At what scale, at what area in km must we reach in order to reliably see consistent occupancy 
#PREDICTION: in areas of fairly uniform habitat type, this scale should be lower 
#PREDICTION: in areas of fairly high habitat heterogeneity, this scale should be higher 
#5)and we look at the straightness or curvature of the actual data 
#as compared to the data derived from our model.
#PREDICTION: focal routes with larger "curvy" values will occur in regions of greater habitat heterogeneity, 
#and deviance from the line will correspond with the greater environmental variance
#associated with the location of that focal route.
#i.e. curvy is a proxy for AUC, where greater deviance of the predicted vals vs the actual vals will result 
#in larger overall curvy values and larger area under the curve

#We explore the variation in this relationship 
#and attempt to characterize whether or not it is best explained by habitat heterogeneity 
#using the variation present across several environmental variables as proxies for habitat heterogeneity. 

#### CURRENT ISSUES #### #revised 09/10/2017

#1) Have below-scale duplicates w/diff starting locations i.e. 
#"scale" = Factor w/83 levels "10-1", "10-2", "10-3", "10-4", "10-5", "5-1", "5-2", "5-3", "5-4", "5-5", "5-6", "5-7", "5-8", etc. 
#no duplicates for 1:66 obvi, these were calculated correctly 
#can I have multi values for a single scale or should I calc avg occ and pctCore and pctTran across the segments w/in a route? 
#i.e. occ/15 at a scale, but scales designated by segments and occ calcd initially based on the starting stop # 
# was told this summer that that was alright and that we were pointedly NOT aggregating across the lower scales, and that's fine 
#BUT: it DOES mean we will have pseudo-duplicates at the lower scales w/diff starting points of segments, and so 
#multiple plotting points for the lower scales instead of a single representative point. This necessitates the "min" qualifier
#in calculating some of the coefficients.  

#2) In calculating the AUC proxy "curvy" values, should I be squaring the differences before summing them? 
#Because we are interested in the magnitude of deviance from the observed values in instances of greater heterogeneity, 
#and not the specific direction - simply adding them could cancel out or diminish the magnitude or gulf of deviance 
#in areas where the deviance is large in a negative direction at some scales, and large in a positive direction in others. 
#These stateroutes would express similar "curviness" values as areas of high homogeneity, where this is little net difference 
#and a smaller magnitude of deviance from the observed values. Because of this, I think we should be squaring and summing. 

#3) Curviness is a great proxy for calculating the AUC per focal route, but it doesn't allow us to see how that changes across scales. 
#Considering having a second df output from the creation of coefs that allows us to see how those individual deviances change 
#esp across scales. 


####Env analysis####
#Background data prep is just environmental data prep, nothing involving occupancy until env_all and core_coefs merge

####abitat hetero measures and scale independent of coefs (for predictions)####   
core_coefs = read.csv("scripts/R-scripts/scale_analysis/core_coefs.csv", header = TRUE) #AUC etc. 
env_all = read.csv("scripts/R-scripts/scale_analysis/intermed/env_all.csv", header = TRUE) #AUC etc. 
#calc areas of scales and run against logA consistently ? 

env_all$area = env_all$scale #*40 etc etc etc

####Coefs to habitat het####

####Coef & habitat heterogeneity models####

#check out cov matrix to inform model generation and predictions:
covmatrix = round(cor(core_env_coefs[, 3:ncol(core_env_coefs)]), 2) #since clipped stateroute don't need to clip again - should I clip scale?
covmatrix = as.data.frame(covmatrix)
write.csv(covmatrix, "scripts/R-scripts/scale_analysis/core_covmatrix.csv", row.names = FALSE)
#mean and var - interpret how covary with coefs and direction - i.e. ndvi mean covaries positively with pmin, 
#but elev mean covaries negatively with pmin 
#and both variances covary negatively with pmin 
#ndvi mean covaries negatively with pthresh, elev mean positively
#no other variables have this divergent relationship in directionality of covariance, 
#ndvi var and elev var always in unison when strong
#hab het variance measures: pslope and pthresh positive, pmin and pmax both negative covariance

#INTERPRETATION: 
#elevation and ndvi at the highest scales explain more variation in the pmin and pthresh values 
#compared to any other measures of habitat heterogeneity 
#However, elevation explains more variation than ndvi at the top scales - AND 
#the gulf between ndvi and elevation in terms of explanatory power widens at the larger scales 
# - the two measures are closer together in importance at the lowest scales. 
#NDVI variance at local scale actually has an 'outlier' point further above even local elev variation 
#depending on which coefficient metric that corresponds to, it may be that ndvi explains more 
#local variation in heterogeneity and variation at the lower scales of the occ-scale relationship 
#while elevational heterogeneity explains variation at the higher scales of the occ-scale relationship?
